# UnityAsyncBridge

**UnityAsyncBridge** is a lightweight and modular Unity package that simplifies the execution of asynchronous operations — including coroutines, `async/await` tasks, and UniTask — through a unified interface.

It provides:
- Easy-to-use managers for coroutines, async methods, and UniTask.
- Callbacks for `onStart`, `onUpdate`, and `onComplete` for every execution.
- Centralized control to help build prototypes and gameplay logic faster.
- Plug-and-play integration with your Unity project (via Git submodule or package URL).

Perfect for rapid prototyping, gameplay scripting, and real-time monitoring of async logic.
